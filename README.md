grunt-haml-sass
===============

This is a simple Gruntfile that converts your haml -> html &amp;&amp; scss -> css. Good for static websites by frontend developers that want to use haml and scss for simple things.

It's so easy!

1. Get NPM.
2. Nothing else!

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install
$ grunt
```
