## Issues

I'm treating the [issues tab](https://github.com/taystack/website/issues) as a blog for my various reviews on emerging technologies. [I've seen it done before](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/07/15/Comments-are-on/) and I think it's creative and fun.

 - [React 16 Hooks. Yar har har](https://github.com/taystack/website/issues/2#issue-567489111)
 

I have plans to make a skinned app that wraps Github issues as a blog frontend. It's a good project to try out builds I've never used.

In `package.json` you can see the other "@taystack" scoped projects I used here.

Feel free to use anything I've built here. I only ask that you reward my hard work with a little shout-out.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
